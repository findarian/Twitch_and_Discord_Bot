# Twitch_and_Discord_Bot

This project is meant to have the ability to post messages from discord commands to twitch chat at different intervals, or have it run continuously after this discord command


# Phase 1
Create a Twitch bot that can successfully post a message to a channel

# Phase 2
Make sure the Twitch bot can post to any channel

# Phase 3
Create a Discord bot that can give commands to the Twitch bot
Create anti-spammer rules within both the Discord and Twitch bot so that users cannot take advantage of spamming others

# Phase 4
Create any requested features of this bot
Create a discord channel for bot feature requests and give access to people


Due to the high likelyhood of abuse from this script from spammers, a way is needed to be found to minimize the spam. Likely a hard limit on requests or other ideas
